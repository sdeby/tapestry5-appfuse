### Project Summary ###
Tapestry has gone through a major rewrite in its latest incarnation (Tapestry 5) to address some of complaints from previous releases and also leverage new features in Java.
As a result, there is no "simple" and direct upgrade path from previous versions to T5. For Tapestry 4 users, it is possible to run T4 and T5 applications side-by-side to smooth the transition.
This project aims at demonstrating and documenting the conversion of a "simple" application from Tapestry 4 to Tapestry 5.
